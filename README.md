- **Automatic Deployments**: Our application is automatically deployed on every code commit, thanks to AWS Amplify's integration with our version control system (GitHub).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: AWS Amplify makes it easy to set up CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Scalability**: Our application scales automatically to handle traffic spikes, ensuring a seamless experience for our users.
- **Serverless Backend**: Leveraging AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway, we've implemented a serverless backend for our application.
